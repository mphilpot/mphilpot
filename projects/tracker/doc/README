Mantis grew out of my need for a simple and easily adaptable bugtracking
system.  I took a look at Bugzilla but I didn't like the interface and
complexity.  Also, I know php but barely know perl.

Originally this was written by a friend of mine but I have taken over the
project entirely.  In any case I completely rewrote his code.  I attempted to
make the HTML fairly modular so people could easily dive into customization.

Security exists though I'm not really in a position to judge how secure.  So,
if you're going to use this try to use it in a semi-private area until this
package has been looked through a few times.

You will need to have php 4.0.6 or higher, mysql 3.23.2 and higher, and a webserver.  You don't
need to know too much about any of them other than how to set them up and some
basic administration commands.

The release numbering convention I'm using is major.minor.micro.
Major indicates a large change in the core package, minor a significant
amount of feature addition/modification, micro for mostly bug fixes.

I'd appreciate an email letting me know if you find this program useful.
I won't publish any information without permission; I'd just like an idea
and knowing I'm helping people will only motivate me more.

Also, let me know if you see any ways I can improve my code or design.
I'm by no means an expert in php or code design.  Insights into better ways
to implement functionality and features will only help out everyone using
the package.
